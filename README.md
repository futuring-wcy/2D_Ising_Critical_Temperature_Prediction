# 2D-Ising-Model-Generation-and-NN-based-prediction

## Description

Simulating 2D Ising model with Monte Carlo Method in Python 3. It is adapted from https://github.com/ybillchen/2D-Ising-Model-Python

And predicting the Ising critical temperature with nueral network.

The code is still immature, you can modify it to make it perform better.
